TestbenchGeneratorAgent -- Generates cocotb testbenches that co-simulate
the RTL against the Python golden model.

Strategy:
- Reads the Python golden model source
- Creates a cocotb test that instantiates the DUT
- Feeds identical stimuli to both Python model and RTL
- Compares outputs bit-exactly
- Extracts test vectors from the existing pytest suite where possible
