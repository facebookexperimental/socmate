Architecture state schema and persistence.

Defines the ArchitectureState dataclass (the shared state across all
specialist agents) and ArchitectureQuestion (the data model for agent-
initiated questions to the human architect).

State is persisted as JSON at .socmate/architecture_state.json so that
MCP tool calls across a Claude CLI conversation share the same state.
In Phase 3, ArchitectureState can be converted to a LangGraph TypedDict
with message reducers.
